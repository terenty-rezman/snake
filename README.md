# snake programming language


tiny interpreted programming language with dynamic typing and just enough instuction set to implement a Snake game

### run the interpreter
``` $ cargo run --release ```

### run the game
``` $ cargo run --release -- snake_src/snake_game.snk ```

> heavily powered by wonderfull [rust-peg parser](https://github.com/kevinmehall/rust-peg/tree/master/tests/run-pass)


> any similarities to __python__ are purely coincidental
